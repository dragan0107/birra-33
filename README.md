# **Birra 33 - Beer catalogue and shop application.**

## [Click here for demo.](https://drip016.github.io/birra-33/page/index.html)

> ### In this project, I had to recreate the entire shop from scratch, based on the reference theme I was given. After that, I started adding more and more functionalities to make it more complex. The front-end of the app communicates with the external API and fetches beers and displays them in the shop list.

## Technologies used:

> **HTML, CSS (SASS), GULP, Bootstrap, Handlebars, JavaScript**

## Functionalities:

- Showing, 10, 20 or all beers (capped to 35 for this project)
- Beers can be displayed in a grid, or a list
- Hovering over a beer, user can open a modal with more info about the beer, or go to the product page
- User can add beers to the cart and input the quantity user want
- Pagination: user can go pages up or down, go to first page, or click which page user would like
- Page is fully responsive for all screen sizes

## Filtering

> User can use different filters to find the beers of their preference, such as:

- Search beers by their name
- Input the range of ABV parameter by using the custom made multi range slider component
- Search beers by their brewed date, (brewed before and brewed after date inputs)
- Finally, user can filter beers by the recommended foods they go with best
